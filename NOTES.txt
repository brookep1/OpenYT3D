Zombie Processes:
 - You might need to use Task Manager to kill the lingering "StereoPlayer.exe"
      processes.
 - Each video you open this method spawns new process

Library Error Message: 
  - If you play another video with the lingering process it will complain about
       library but you can say OK and it should continue

 URL Error Message:   
  - The format of the media URL from YouTube passed to the video player might be strange. 
  - RETRY with the same video and it will change to a different URL. 
      Probably will work after retry
