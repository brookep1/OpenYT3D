#Open Youtube in 3DVision Stereo Video Player
https://github.com/brookep1/OpenYT3D

This helper batch script can be used to play 3D Youtube videos on the standard NVidia 3DVision Player

##Features:

You give it the video URL or ID and streams directly from Youtube, you don't have to wait to download it first then play it. 

The video does not have to be tagged in Youtube as a 3D video first. It will accept and play any Half SBS video that is posted.

No need for an HTML5 browser. No Flash. And no special plugins necessary. It does not use your browser at all. 

Also no fancy .NET libraries or similar. Fancy GUI's are old school. Simple text screens are the future.
